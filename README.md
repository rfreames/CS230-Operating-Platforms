**Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?**

The Gaming Room is a client that hosts game applications available on Android. They have an application called Draw It or Lose It which is available on Android. The game  is based on rendering images which players use to guess either a phrase, title, or thing. They want to develop Draw It or Lose It so that is able to be run on multiple operating systems using a web browser, and in particular would like the software available for Linux, Windows, macOS, iOS, and Android.

**What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?**

I think I did particularly well developing the executive summary and determining design constraints based on the client's needs. By understanding the client's needs I could begin to narrow down what actually had to be programmed for the application to work as they wanted it to.

**What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?**

The domain model and design criteria both helped when creating an initial draft of the program. Using the UML diagram in particular made it much easier to visualize the different classes and interconnectivity required to have the program function properly.

**If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?**

If I were to revise a part of my work, I would likely revise the storage and memory management recommendation sections. While I think my general recommendations were valid for the project's purposes, I think I could have done a better job getting into the OS side of how these items are managed, rather than giving a very high-level overview. I would delve a bit deeper into how Linux actually manages these items.

**How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?**

I began by summarizing the client's end-goal, then making a list of specific items the client requested. From there, a UML was created showing how various classes were going to work together. When designing the user's needs must always be kept in mind as they are the reason the software is being created. As such, all user requirements must be met and design must focus on adequately meeting these needs. In the business world there is a lot of competition, so if one were to poorly develop software, the user could very easily go elsewhere to meet their needs, causing either the individual or company to lose business.

**How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?**

I started by using the UML diagram that was created for the purposes of the project. From there, I implemented one section at a time so as to thoroughly make sure the code was accurate and working as intended. Once this was done, I did various tests to make sure that different use cases would still yield the correct results. In the future, I imagine that when working with clients I will take a similar approach, starting with a simple overview of what the client wants, translating it into a UML or other easy to understand diagram, then implement one section at a time and test as I build up the software.
